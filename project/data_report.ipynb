Downloader takes a link, downloads the corresponding file and saves it locally. The transformer does manipulation on the raw data. After transformation, the loader loads the processed data to CSV file.\n",

    "All the pipelines output the data in a CSV file with headers. Since the CSV is lightweight and easy to load and interpret, it's used. Data source 1 might be inaccurate, since it's collected and computed from multiple data sources. Some of the results are estimated, leading to some bias. And because the publisher is an environmentalism NGO, the exaggeration of CO2 emission can occur, which is biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential issue of the final report is the weak correlation between CO2 and soil condition. The soil condition depends on too many factors. Solely CO2 emission,temperature and precipitation might not contribute too much. Therefore, a weak correlation may occur. And in the data source of CO2, it only indicates how much it emits annually with ignoring the amount absorbed by nature. Low amount of CO2 in the atmosphere can happen, which can bias the analysis. \n",
